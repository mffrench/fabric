Overview
========

Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned
by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency,
flexibility and scalability.  It is designed to support pluggable implementations
of different components, and accomodate the complexity and intricacies that exist
across the economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point.

The key design features woven into Hyperledger Fabric fulfill its promise of a
comprehensive, yet customizable, enterprise blockchain solution:

* :ref:`Assets` - Asset definitions enable the exchange of almost anything with
  monetary value over the network, from whole foods to antique cars to currency
  futures.
* :ref:`Chaincode`  Chaincode execution is partitioned from transaction ordering,
  limiting the required levels of trust and verification across node types, and
  optimizing network scalability and performance.
* :ref:`Ledger-Features` - The immutable, shared ledger encodes the entire
  transaction history for each channel, and includes SQL-like query capability
  for efficient auditing and dispute resolution.
* :ref:`Privacy-through-Channels` - Channels enable multi-lateral transactions
  with the high degrees of privacy and confidentiality required by competing
  businesses and regulated industries that exchange assets on a common network.
* :ref:`Security-Membership-Services` - Permissioned membership provides a
  trusted blockchain network, where participants know that all transactions can
  be detected and traced by authorized regulators and auditors.
* :ref:`Consensus` - Fabric's unique approach to consensus enables the
  flexibility and scalability needed for the enterprise.
